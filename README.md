# Nginx Auth Request Module

## Introduction 

The `ngx_http_auth_request_module` is a module authored by
[Maxim Dounin](http://mdounin.ru), member of the core
[Nginx](http://nginx.org) team.

Maxim mantains a mercurial
[repository](http://mdounin.ru/hg/ngx_http_auth_request_module) with
the latest version of the code.

The module allows for the *insertion* of subrequests in the
authorization process being handled by Nginx. A more or less obvious
application is using this module as a very fast and specific
WAF. Meaning a WAF without all the ugliness that something like
Apache's `mod_security` promotes. No bizarre syntax, no reloading of
the config. Just add a small script that implements the set of
filtering rules that you want to implement. There's no need for any
behemoth module that hurts server performance and keep a consultant on
a retainer.

Suppose that you want to filter any occurence of the `UNION`, `SELECT`
and `DROP` statement in the URI. Suppose that the backoffice of your
app is located at `/bo`. This will do the trick:

    location ^~ /bo {
        error_page 401 403 $my_error_page;
        auth_basic 'Classified Access';
        auth_basic_user_file .htpasswd-bo-users;
        auth_request /auth;
        auth_request_set $my_error_page $upstream_http_x_error_page;
    }

    location /auth {
        if ($request_uri ~* (?:select|union|drop)) {
           return 403;
        }
        return 200;
    }
    
Let's follow the example. There's a request for an URI like this:

    /bo/?u=john_doe'; DROP TABLE users--
    
 1. This request is served by the `^~ /bo` location. There the
    `request_auth` location redirects to `/auth`.
    
 2. Now we're on `/auth` and we check the `if` condition regex. We
    have a match with `DROP`. Hence we deny authorization by returning
    a 403 status code, i.e., `403 Access Denied`.
    
 3. If we had requested an **acceptable** URI then we returned 200
    from the `/auth` location and we proceeded as usual to the
    following stage.

 4. The `$my_error_page` variable is set to the value of the
    `X-Error-Page` header. This can be used for having specific error
    pages for each error, for example. This is the error page for 403
    and 401 errors.  

You might say that this example didn't needed to use `auth_request` in
the first place. Indeed you could have done everything using a simple
[`map`](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpMapModule#map) directive like this:

    map $request_uri $attempt_sql_injection {
        default 0;
        ~*(?:select|union|drop) 1;
    }

include it in the `http` context of your Nginx instance and set:
    
    location ^~ /bo {
        auth_basic 'Classified Access';
        auth_basic_user_file .htpasswd-bo-users;
        
        if ($attempt_sql_injection) {
            return 403;
        }
    }
    
Yes. But this was just an example to give you a hint towards
realizing all the potential uses of this handy module.
    
Here's a quick braindump of potential uses of the `auth_request` module.
    
 1. Easily implement [two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication)
    by invoking a script in the `/auth` location.
    
 2. Implement Single Sign On systems.
 
 3. Filter requests and prevent vulnerabilities like
    [SQL injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_injection),
    [XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29),
    etc.
    
 4. Complex caching strategies.
 
 5. Web services implementations. 
 
And much, much more. No limit to your imagination. Dream on.

## Module directives

**auth_request** `uri` | `off`

**default:** `off`

**context:** `http`, `server`, `location`

Enables the `auth_request` module in a given context where the request
for authorization will be made to the `uri` defined.

<br/>
<br/>

**auth_request_set** `variable` `value`

**default:** `none`

**context:** `http`, `server`, `location`

Sets the value of the `variable` to `value` after the completion of
the authorization request.

## Caveats 

Note that the module discards the request body. Therefore if you're
proxying to an upstream you must set
[`proxy_pass_request_body`](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpProxyModule#proxy_pass_request_body)
to `off` and set the `Content-Length` header to a null string. Here's
an example:

    location = /auth {
        proxy_pass http://auth_backend;
        proxy_pass_request_body off;
        proxy_set_header Content-Length "";
        proxy_set_header X-Original-URI $request_uri;
    }
    
You cannot use
[`proxy_cache`](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpProxyModule#proxy_cache)/[`proxy_store`](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpProxyModule#proxy_store)
or
[`fastcgi_cache`](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpFcgiModule#fastcgi_cache)/[`fastcgi_store`](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpFcgiModule#fastcgi_store)
for requests involving `auth_request`.

## Installation 

 1. Grab the source from the mercurial
    [tip](http://mdounin.ru/hg/ngx_http_auth_request_module/archive/tip.tar.gz)
    or clone this repo:

        git clone git://github.com/perusio/nginx-auth-request-module.git
    
 2.  2. Add the module to the build configuration by adding
    `--add-module=/path/to/ngx_http_auth_request_module`.
    
 3. Build the nginx binary.
 
 4. Install nginx binary.
 
 5. Configure contexts where `auth_request` is enabled.
 
 6. Done.
 
## Other builds
 
If you fancy a bleeding edge Nginx package (from the dev releases) for
Debian made to measure then you might be interested in my
[debian](http://debian.perusio.net/unstable) Nginx
package. Instructions for using the repository and making the package
live happily inside a stable distribution installation are
[provided](http://debian.perusio.net).
